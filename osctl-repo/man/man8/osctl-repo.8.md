## NAME
`osctl-repo` - manage and interact with container images repositories

## SYNOPSIS
`osctl-repo` [*global options*] *command* [*command options*] [*arguments...*]

## DESCRIPTION
`osctl-repo` is a tool for accessing and managing container image repositories.
It works in two modes: `local` and `remote`.

In the `local` mode, `osctl-repo` manages container image repository in a chosen
directory. It can be used add, remove and configure images. `osctl-repo` does
not build the images, `osctl-image` can be used for that purpose.

The `remote` mode is used to interact with a remote repository over HTTP. In
this mode, `osctl-repo` can download remote images and keep them in a local
cache.
