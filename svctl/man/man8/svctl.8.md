## NAME
`svctl` - `runit` service and runlevel manager

## SYNOPSIS
`svctl` [*global options*] *command* [*command options*] [*arguments...*]

## DESCRIPTION
`svctl` is a command-line tool that manages `runit` services and runlevels. It
is an abstraction on top of symlinks and `runsvchdir`. `runit` services are
stored in `/etc/runit/services`. Each runlevel is represented by a directory in
`/etc/runit/runsvdir` and contains links to services in `/etc/runit/services`.
`svctl` manages these symlinks.

`svctl` operates on the current system state. If you're using vpsAdminOS as
a live system, the changes will not be persistent. You need to make the changes
in your Nix configuration if you wish them to be permanent. `svctl` is useful
for temporary runlevel changes, such as on-demand runlevel switching and
enabling/disabling of services.

## COMMANDS
`list-services` `-a` | [*runlevel*]
  List either all services and their runlevels or services enabled
  in *runlevel*.

    `-a`, `--all`
      List services from all runlevels.

`enable` *service* [*runlevel*]
  Enable *service* in *runlevel*. *runlevel* defaults to `current`. This is
  an equivalent of
  `ln -s /etc/runit/services/<service> /etc/runit/runsvdir/<runlevel>/<service>`.

`disable` *service* [*runlevel*]
  Disable *service* from *runlevel*. *runlevel* defaults to `current`. This is
  an equivalent of `rm -f /etc/runit/runsvdir/<runlevel>/<service>`.

`protect` *service-pattern*
  Configure *service-pattern* to be skipped when switching to a new system
  configuration. Matching services will not be restarted if they are changed by
  the new system version. This setting is not persisted across system reboots.

  The list of protected services is stored at `/run/runit/protected-services.txt`.

`unprotect` *service-pattern*
  Reverse `svctl protect` and allow *service-pattern* to be restarted or reloaded
  when system configuration is switched.

`list-protected`
  List protected services.

`list-runlevels`
  List available runlevels.

`runlevel`
  Print the current runlevel. `/etc/runit/runsvdir/current` points to the
  current runlevel.

`switch` *runlevel*
  Switch to *runlevel*. This is equivalent to `runsvchdir <runlevel>`. Services
  that are no longer enabled will be stopped and new services will be started.
  It may take several seconds for `runit` to notice the change.
