module OsCtld
  # This module adds support for inclusive/exclusive object locking.
  #
  # {Lockable} should be used for synchronization of osctld state. The locks
  # should be held only for a short time to read/modify the state.
  # Use {Manipulable} for long operations that require locking. Ideally, the
  # included methods should be treated as protected, i.e. should not be used
  # from the outside.
  #
  # If the thread waits for {Lockable::Lock::TIMEOUT} seconds to acquire
  # the lock, an exception is raised.
  #
  # Multiple threads can hold inclusive locks at the same time, but only one
  # thread can hold an exclusive one. When a thread has acquired an exclusive
  # lock, no other thread can get inclusive, nor exclusive lock.
  #
  # Before the locks can be used, `init_lock()` has to be called. Locks can then
  # be acquired using `lock()` and released using `unlock()`. You can also use
  # `inclusively()` and `exclusively()` to execute a block within the lock.
  #
  # {Lockable} provides helpers for synchronized alternatives to `attr_reader`,
  # `attr_writer` and `attr_accessor`:
  #
  #     attr_inclusive_reader :attr1, :attr2, ...
  #     attr_exclusive_writer :attr1, :attr2, ...
  #     attr_synchronized_accessor :attr1, :attr2, ...
