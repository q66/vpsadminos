module OsCtl::Exporter
  # Encapsulate Prometheus registry to allow atomic update of resetable metrics
  #
  # Metrics are exported from one registry, while new metrics are saved to a new
  # registry. When the new metrics have been collected, the new registry
  # atomically replaces the old one.
  #
  # This process is needed, since osctl-exporter re-register metrics to get rid
  # of old values, e.g. so that we do not export metrics for containers that
  # no longer exist. This is done by unregistering the metric and then
  # registering it again, which can lead to incomplete data being exported if
  # the client connects during this process.
